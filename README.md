## **Configuration**

### **Default Paths**
The extension automatically checks for the following predefined directories:
- `node_modules/.bin`
- `vendor/bin`

### **Custom Paths**
You can add custom directories by modifying the settings:
1. Open **Settings** (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
2. Search for **"Auto Path Manager"**.
3. Add your custom directories under the `autoAddPathsToTerminal.additionalPaths` setting.

Alternatively, you can edit the `settings.json` file directly:
```json
"autoAddPathsToTerminal.additionalPaths": [
    "custom/bin",
    "tools/bin"
]
```

## **Usage**
1. Open a terminal in VSCode.
2. The extension will automatically add the configured directories to the terminal's PATH.
3. Verify the updated PATH:
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      echo $PATH
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```cmd
      echo %PATH%
      ```
